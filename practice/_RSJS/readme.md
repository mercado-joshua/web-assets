# Foreword
* get rid of inline javascript
* html can have components that have behaviours.
* apply javascript to a [data-js-behavior-name] selector

# Structure
* Think that a piece of JavaScript code to will only affect 1 “component”, that is, a section in the DOM.
* It’s preferred to **mark your component with a data-js-___ attribute**.
