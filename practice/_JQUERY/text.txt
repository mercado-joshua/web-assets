#### JSON
json and javascript are not the same thing

#### REST API
service - a function/method that can be reused

e.g
addService, weatherService, validateXMLService

web service - service that is accessed over the web, has request and response

api - the way you do the interfacing
application programming interface

-expose an interface

REST - REpresentational State Transfer
a design pattern

token based rest API
-authentication
--to access the rest api, you need to have proper userid and password
-- userid and password are the authentication to connect

-authorization
--the kind of operation that is allowed to perform on the resource
--token is nothing but a key issued by the server to client with some permission
--client cab use this value and pass it to a server everytime it connects and prove it has authorization to access the resource

token based rest api means having the authorization to access the resource using the token key
