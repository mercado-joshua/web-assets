Promise object is used for asynchronous computations.

represents a value which may be available "now", or in the "future", or "never"

ex. you perform a http request from the server and the server takes 5secs to process the request,

and may the case, the server says:

1. everything is fine and get some data back

2. there's an error, we'll send you a message explaining what was wrong with the request

3. or you wont getting any response beacusethe database was not doing something and you never recieve any response back

to model the situation:

promises states:

pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.

fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully

rejected: meaning that the operation failed

create a promise object:

if fulfilled (.then)
if rejected (.catch)
*/

// to create a promise

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    // mimick a request to the server and eithe gat a response back or an error that something went wrong

    // a. callback - this is waht is executed
    // b. when you want this to invoke, after how many milliseconds
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("data back from the server");
    }, 3000);

    setTimeout(() => {
        reject("no data back from the server, there was an error");
    }, 5000);
});

// to use the promise
  promise.then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  })
