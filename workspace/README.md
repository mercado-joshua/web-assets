> *I hope my setup helps you to have an overview of what might `gulpfile.js` really contains, there are so much articles about setting up gulp which makes it difficult to choose which one works for you, I bet every developer has it's own version of configuration, so don't be afriad to choose what's works for you. feel free to use mine if you like it though.*
