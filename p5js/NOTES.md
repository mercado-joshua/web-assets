## Here’s my five-step method to get started with creative coding.

* Take a creative coding course.
* Try out the programming language or the packages available for drawing.
* Get inspiration from creative coding artists.
* Create your process of creative coding.
* Execute your first creative coding project.


## Create Your Creative Coding Process
Every artist has a process for generating their artwork. Finding your process is as important as creating the artwork.
Here’s a sample of a creative coding process:


* Find an inspiration: a word, a painting, an object, a shape, etc.
* Sketch out what you envision your artwork to be.
* Visualize interactions—with the environment, with data, with math, etc.
* Create the algorithm.
* Create your artwork with a programming language you choose.
* Go through iterations of editing and exploration to reach your final product.
